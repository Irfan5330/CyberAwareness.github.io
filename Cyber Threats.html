        <h1>What are Cyber Threats</h1>
        <p>Cyber threats pose significant risks to individuals, businesses, and society as a whole, making it essential to understand their importance and impact. These threats encompass various malicious activities such as malware infections, phishing attacks, ransomware incidents, and data breaches, all of which can have devastating consequences.
        Cyber threats are important to address because they compromise the security and integrity of personal and sensitive information, leading to financial loss, identity theft, and fraud. Moreover, they can disrupt critical infrastructure, businesses operations, and essential services, causing significant economic and societal disruptions.
        Beyond financial implications, cyber threats erode trust and confidence in online platforms, undermining the digital economy and exacerbating concerns about privacy and security. In essence, addressing cyber threats is crucial for protecting individuals' and organizations' assets, preserving trust in digital technologies, and fostering a safe and resilient digital environment for all.</p>

        <h1>Malware Attacks:</h1>
        <p>Malicious software, or malware, includes viruses, worms, Trojans, ransomware, and spyware.</p>
        <p>Impact: Malware can infect systems, steal sensitive information, disrupt operations, and even demand ransom payments.</p>

        <h1>Phishing Attacks:</h1>
        <p>Phishing involves deceptive emails, messages, or websites designed to trick individuals into revealing personal information or clicking on malicious links.</p>
        <p>Impact: Phishing attacks can lead to identity theft, financial loss, unauthorized access to accounts, and compromised systems.</p>

        <h1>Denial-of-Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) Attacks:</h1>
        <p>DoS and DDoS attacks overwhelm a system or network with excessive traffic, causing it to become slow or unavailable.</p>
        <p>Impact: DoS and DDoS attacks can disrupt services, cause financial losses, and damage an organization's reputation.</p>

        <h1>Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:</h1>
        <p>SQL injection exploits vulnerabilities in web applications to manipulate databases and execute unauthorized SQL commands.</p>
        <p>Impact: SQL injection attacks can lead to data breaches, unauthorized access to sensitive information, and website defacement.</p>

        <h1>Zero-Day Exploits:</h1>
        <p>Zero-day exploits target vulnerabilities in software that are not yet known to the vendor or have not been patched.</p>
        <p>Impact: Zero-day exploits can enable attackers to gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code, and compromise systems before a patch is available.</p>

        <h1>Social Engineering Attacks:</h1>
        <p>Social engineering manipulates individuals into divulging confidential information or performing actions that compromise security.</p>
        <p>Impact: Social engineering attacks can lead to data breaches, identity theft, and unauthorized access to systems and resources.</p>
